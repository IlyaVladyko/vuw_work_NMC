Project Neu(t)ralMC: energy-efficient open source Monte Carlo algorithm for assessing photon transport in turbid media

Light propagation in turbid mediums such as atmosphere, fluids and biological
tissues is a challenging problem which necessitates accurate simulation techniques to account
for the effects of multiple scattering. The Monte Carlo method has long established itself as a
gold standard and is widely adopted for simulating light transport, however, its computationally
intensive nature often requires significant processing power and energy consumption. In this
project a novel, open source Monte Carlo algorithm is introduced which is specifically designed for
use with energy-efficient processors, effectively addressing those challenges, while maintaining
the accuracy/compatibility and outperforming existing solutions. The proposed implementation
optimizes photon transport simulations by exploiting the unique capabilities of Appleâ€™s low-
power, high-performance M-family of chips. The developed method has been implemented in an
open-source software package, enabling seamless adaptation of developed algorithms for specific
applications. The accuracy and performance are validated using comprehensive comparison with
existing solvers commonly used for Biomedical Imaging. The results demonstrate that the new
algorithm achieves comparable accuracy levels to those of existing techniques while significantly
reducing computational time and energy consumption.
